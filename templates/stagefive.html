                <h2>Meet JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is THE programming language of the web. There are two was of adding it: firstly into the html through a script tag <span class = "code">&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span> or in a separate .js file. Like <a href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/adding-script-html#external-scripts">here</a>.</p>

                    Here are some new concepts:
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Declaring variables: the syntax is the same for strings and numbers. var declares a new variable for all data types: <span class = "code"> var variableName = someValue</span>.</li>
                    	<li>Replacing strings: follow the format <span class = "code">string.replace("old","new")</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    You can use the console of the webbrowser to debug your Javascript: <br>

                    <span class = "code">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;</span><br>
					<span class = "code">var firstName = "Jeremie";</span><br>
					<span class = "code">console.log (firstName);</span><br>
					<span class = "code">&lt;/script&gt;</span><br>

            <div class = "topic">
            <h2>The power of APIs</h2>
            <p>XML was invented in the 1990's to facilitate computer to computer communication. It is related to html as they have a common ancestor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">SGML</a>, invented in the 1980's. Html can actually be expressed as XML, using the type xhtml oin the DOCTYPE.</p>

            <p>Some characteristics of xml are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>there is no void tag, every opening tag needs a closing one</li>
                <li>You can have an empty tag in this form: &lt;tag/&gt;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Python has a built in parser in a library called minidom. It can imported like this: <span class="code">from xml.dom import minidom</span>. This is a lightweight and fast version of the more comprehensive dom (document object model) that can be used to parse gigabits of data.</p>

            To parse xml (create an object from code) and store the result in a variable, you can use the following:
            <br>
            <span class = "code">p =  minidom.parseString("&lt;mytag&gt;contents!&lt;children&gt;&lt;item&gt;1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/children&gt;&lt;/mytag&gt;")</span>

            To visualise the structure of the resulting object, including available methods, you can use <span class="code">dir(p)</span>, or if you want it in a vertical fashion, <span class="code">import pprint</span> ("pretty print") and write <span class = "code">pprint.pprint(dir(p))</span>.

            To visualise the content in a XML format: <br>
            <span class = "code">print p.toprettyxml()</span>

            To get the "1" above we would have to use the following:<br>
            <span class = "code">p.getElementByTagName("item")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue</span>

            <br>

            Another tool for computers to communicate is JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It consists of nested dictionaries, lists and lists of dictionaries:

            <span class = "code">{ "itenaries":[ {"from": "SEO",</span><br>
            <span class = "code">                "to" : "IAD"},</span><br>
            <span class = "code">                 {"from" : "IAD",</span><br>
            <span class = "code">                 "to" : "SEO"} ]</span><br>
            <span class = "code">}</span><br>

            To use json in python you must first import it.
            To visualise a JSON object stored in a j variable, enter: <br>
            <span class = "code">json.loads(j)</span>. Include 'print' if not run from bash.
            To have a quick look at the keys progressively available at each level:
            <span class = "code">j.keys()</span>
            <span class = "code">j['data'].keys()</span>
            <span class = "code">j['data']['children'].keys()</span>
            Be aware that hackers could use JSON to sneak code in your system...

            <br>
            Some websites make their contents available in other formats that html: <br>
            www.reddit.com/.json or www.reddit.com/.xml

            There are other protocols used by servers to communicate:
            <ul>
                <li>SOAP (Microsoft): very complicated</li>
                <li>Protocol buffers (Google): similar to JSON</li>
                <li>Thrift (Facebook)</li>
                <li>Plain text, custom formats</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall, make sure to rate-limit yourself to avoid hitting servers too hard and that you write good user-agents so that people building the APIs that use can contact you if something goes wrong.</p>

            <p>The small form below implements an API that returns the possible gender of a name entered by a user. Even thought there are 5,000 names available, some common ones are missing('David'???).</p>

            <form>
                <input type="Name" placeholder="Enter name...">
                <input type="submit"> <br>
                Gender: %s
            </form>

                <p>Combining CSS and JavaScript can be very useful to design web pages that will render well on any browser and on screens of any size.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of pleasure experimenting with the Dash tool created by General Assembly and it really made me realise how flexible web-design can be. It inspired me to use JQuery to create a "Night mode" for this page: </p>
