1. Description
----------------
This website was created as a note-taking and programming exercise for Udacity's Introduction to programming Nanodegree.

The three main features are:
- a ["leave a comment"](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/comments) section that will let a user enter a comment but will do a few checks for spam before posting it to the database
- a [Wikipedia API endpoint](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/five#summary) that lets a user enter a search into a field and see the page updated with a Wikipedia summary of the search. It is implemented using regular expressions to clean the strings.
- a javascript ["night mode"](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/five#summary) colour scheme that a user can activate when pressing a button at the bottom of the same page. Another button allows the user to switch between the page's original style and a more modern one.

The final result is visible [here](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/).


3. Issues and known bugs
-------------------------
None at this point in time


4. More information
-------------------
I improved the API by using regular expressions to clean the strings and plan to improve the mobile experience over time.
