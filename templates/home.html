            <h1>IPND - Jeremie's Notes</h1>
            <p>For years, I tried to learn programming without really getting anywhere. I tried to learn C++, then Java, then VBA, then Objective C...</p>

            <p>What I didn't realise was that I was trying to learn a programming language rather than learning how to program.</p>

            <p>I joined the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree mid 2015 and in a few months I have made more progress than I previously had in years. It looks like Udacity may have a winning formula on their hands.</p>
