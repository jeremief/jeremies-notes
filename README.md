1. Description
----------------
This website was created as a note-taking and programming exercise for Udacity's Introduction to programming Nanodegree.

The three main features are:
- a ["leave a comment"](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/comments) section that will let a user enter a comment but will refuse to post it if contains swear words
- a [Wikipedia API endpoint](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/five#summary) that lets a user enter a search into a field and see the page updated with a Wikipedia summary of the search
- a javascript ["night mode"](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/five#summary) colour scheme that a user can activate when pressing a button at the bottom of the same page

The final result is visible [here](https://jeremies-notes.appspot.com/).


3. Issues and known bugs
-------------------------
For some reason, searching for "World War II" doesn't return anything...
Also, sometimes the JSON cleaning function doesn't work properly and the summary contains some leftover html code.


4. More information
-------------------
I plan on improving the API and mobile experience over time.
